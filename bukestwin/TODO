RQ: error handling
Title-seed-free mode
Multiple workers, set them up
CUDA on the server...!
Limit number of jobs one client can start/ starting new job kills the old one
    e.g. use session? add session key to rq job and delete all jobs w/ session key when new job submitted??
Report Position in the queue

Get rid of flash messages?

Worker script to sample network: Make this better and mode efficient
Sampling workaround:

Split at \n\n or \n\nTITLE:
If there's no \n\n or \n\nTITLE, then
sample again with seed = last line.
